# SFUSD COVID Cases Tracker
#### Hello, this is the repository for a work-in-progress website that I'm creating using Python/Flask, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and Javascript/Chart.js to scrape and display data from the [**SFUSD Covid-19 Dashboard**](https://www.sfusd.edu/covid-19-response-updates-and-resources/health-and-safety-guidelines/when-someone-gets-sick/covid-19-testing-dashboard)! I'm collecting data to make a table with the cumulative COVID-19 cases which will also be displayed on a line graph. I hope this data can help people see how COVID-19 is impacting schools in SFUSD over time.
#### If you want to check out my progress so far, I'm hosting my website on Heroku over [**here**](https://sfusdcovidtracker.herokuapp.com/). If you can think of some changes that could help improve my project, don't hesitate to submit an issue ticket! If you do not know how to submit an issue, here is a [**tutorial**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). 
### UPDATE (4/10/22): Currently fixing a issue where the new cases on ordered on the bottom instead of the top and sometimes duplicated for January case numbers. Until then, please refer to this [**Twitter account**](https://twitter.com/sfschoolmonitor?lang=en) (not mine but it is an amazing resource) for daily updates on the cases!
