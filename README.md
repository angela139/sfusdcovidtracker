# SFUSD COVID Cases Tracker
#### Hello, this is the repository for a work-in-progress website that I'm creating using Python/Flask, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and Javascript/Chart.js to scrape and display data from the [**SFUSD Covid-19 Dashboard**](https://www.sfusd.edu/covid-19-response-updates-and-resources/health-and-safety-guidelines/when-someone-gets-sick/covid-19-testing-dashboard)! I'm collecting data to make a table with the cumulative COVID-19 cases which will also be displayed on a line graph. I hope this data can help people see how COVID-19 is impacting schools in SFUSD over time.
#### If you want to check out my progress so far, I'm hosting my website on Heroku over [**here**](https://sfusdcovidtracker.herokuapp.com/). If you can think of some changes that could help improve my project, don't hesitate to submit an issue ticket! If you do not know how to submit an issue, here is a [**tutorial**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). Also, if you are a coder, you can fork my repo, make changes, and submit a pull request. If you don't know how to do that, you're a coder, so Stackoverflow and Google should be second nature by now. 
#### If you are instead from SFUSD and want to sue me for taking your data, please understand that I can only pay you in $5 boba drinks from Happy Lemon (mango boba green tea specifically) ðŸ™ƒ.
